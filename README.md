## Considerations

### Generated models
```
bond_api
- id
- type
- total_sell
- price_total
- create_id
- buyer_id

user_api
- id
- email
- username
- password

banxico_externalapi
- id
- last_date 
- dollar_price
```
## bond_api
- All users can buy and sell bond if they are logged in
- Regular expressions were made to validate the data when they enter the system
- In the case of price_total, it was decided to save the data as decimals and not as a string to facilitate future operations.
- Create_id and buyer_id are foreign keys to users
- When creating a bond, internally it relates the user to creator_id


## user_api
- To authenticate, the JWT library was used, with email and password.
- You need to loggin to use the api, with the exception
/api/tokens/ and /api/refesh


## banxico_externalapi
- As the USD Exchange rate varies only from Monday to Friday, and on Saturdays and Sunday does not has new values, for this model it was decided take as a refer the last Friday USD Exchange rate.
- A logic was added to handle the date and reduce the number of requests to the external api.

## Running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è
```bash
python manage.py test
```
### Unit test

```bash
- login
- user creation
- get bond list MNX
- get bond list USD
- create one bond to sell
- create many bond to sell
- buy a bond
```
## CLIENT REQUERIMENTS CHECKLIST
### SELL
- Can the user sell publish one or more bonds per sale? üëç, LIST ARE USED

- Each item published include: 
    - Name of type of bond as a string with a m√≠nimum of 3 and m√°ximum of 40 alphanumeric chars? üëç
    - Number of bond for sale as a integer with an inclusive range of 1 to 10,000? üëç
    - Selling Price of the total number of bonds for sales, as a monetary value with an inclusive range of 0.0000 to 100,000,000.0000 and a resolution of four decimal numbers? üëç
    The number is received in the format 100,000,000.0000 but it is saved as a decimal to facilitate operations.
        - The selling Price it is represented in Mexican Pesos (MXN)?  üëç
- Does the API respond with an error when a user publishes √≠tems that do not comply with the parameters described aboved? üëç
- Does the system assign a unique ID for each publication? üëç
- Does the system assign a unique ID for each publication and link it to the user that submits it? üëç

### BUY
- Is the user able to list the published √≠tems and buy them trough a unique ID? üëç, BOND BY BOND 
- Is a published item considered ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù if they always have a buyer linked to it? üëç
- Does the API throw an error indicating that the operation is invalid if a buyer tries to buy an item that has already been bought? üëç 
- Does the buyer have an option to list the published √≠tems in USD dollars using the most recent exchage rate published by Banco de Mexico? üëç A model was added to save the exchange value of the peso against the dollar, to avoid constant requests to the external api.

### ADITIONAL REQUERIMENTS
- Does the API implement an authentication? üëç, BY JWT with duration of 1 hour per token.
- Are only authenticated users able to make API calls? üëç, EXCEPT TO CREATE A NEW USER AND TO AUTHENTICATE. 
- Does the API have a rate of 1000 calls/ min? üëç [the following documentation was used](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/#throttling) , EXCEPT FOR THE AUTHENTICATION METHODS.
- If you have experience with unit test, did you add your code? üëç
- If you have experience with Docker, did you create a container in wich the system runs? üëç
- Did you add a Dockerfile and usage instructions to the repository? üëç
- Did you include documentation that indicates how the project should be launched and how the API calls should be made? üëç
- Did you describe the main considerations you take during the development of your solution? üëç
- Can the solution be run locally? üëç
- Does it allow interaction trough a terminal trough http calls, or trough an interactive API explorer? üëç
